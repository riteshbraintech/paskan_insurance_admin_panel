We are building a web-based insurance brokerage platform for the Thai market that allows users to compare, select, and purchase insurance policies online. The platform will integrate with insurance company APIs to fetch real-time plans based on user input. Payments will be made directly to insurers (as per OIC regulations), and commissions.
